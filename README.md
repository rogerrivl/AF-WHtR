# WHtR Calculator

[Try it here](https://rogerrivl.github.io/AF-WHtR/)

This project was created to help airmen and guardians calculate their WHtR. The Department of the Air Force is establishing new Body Composition Program standards for Airmen and Guardians after the abdominal circumference was removed from the Air Force-specific Physical Fitness Assessment in 2020.  

Both the Air and Space Forces released the new Waist-to-Height Ratio BCP policy in January, with assessments to begin April 2023. The Body Composition Assessment is a separate and distinct measurement that is not part of the DAF Physical Fitness Assessment. 

WHtR measures excess fat distribution in the abdominal region and is calculated by dividing waist circumference by height. Excess fat distribution in the abdominal region is associated with increased health risk.
